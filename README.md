# ImageZipCode

# Try it yourself!
Go to https://evt-frontend.herokuapp.com/ 
(please allow up to 30 seconds when the page first load. Heroku free tier makes the app *goes to sleep* after 30 minutes of no traffic.
That being said, the first get zipcode request might take up to 30 seconds as well; to *wake up* the back-end server.)
